After a long time blogging with WordPress, I moved to Jekyll, as I want to fully control my data and host the website for free.

{% highlight ruby %}
def print_hi(name)
  puts "Hi, #{name}"
end
print_hi('my guest')
#=> prints 'Hi, my guest' to STDOUT.
{% endhighlight %}

- Ok, I want to come back to [Google][google-home]
