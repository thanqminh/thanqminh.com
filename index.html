<p><b>My life as a developer:</b></p>
<p>I started using computer running Ms-Dos when I was 10. I began programming in Pascal when I was 13. I got several awards in Algorithmic programming at high school. I realized the power of computer and the its incredible potential of making our life better from then.</p>
<p>My computer background knowledge is built during my bachelor study at HCMUT with different courses about Algorithm & Discrete Mathematics, Data Structure & Database, Distributed System, AI, Programming Language & Compiler, OOP, Data communication & Network, DSP, Computer Graphics, Computer Architecture & OS, Microprocessor & Embedded system. <br>
    I used different programming languages to do labs & assignments for these courses: C++ (algorithmic, socket & graphic programming), Java (OOP), Java bytecode (Compiler), Matlab (DSP), Prolog & Lisp & Smalltalk (Programming language lab), C# & SQL (database-related courses & capstone project)</p>
<p>From June 2009, I finished all classes in my bachelor study except my bachelor thesis and capstone project, so I started my career life from then. As my first job is a web developer in IO Media, I built company and school websites and their CMS using PHP (with a MVC framework).</p>
<p>After graduated from my bachelor program in the beginning of 2010, I took some network administration courses (MCSA & CCNA).</p>
<p>From August 2010, I started my master study in Computer Science at Ã˜stfold College. My master study is specialized in Design of Digital Environment (Information Architecture), which includes advanced courses in HCI design, Data Mining, Digital Environment & Media. </p>
<p>My master thesis project is to built a prototype for Norwegian personal digital archive, which requires research in data format, metadata, XSD & XML, archive format, digital archive system design, personal media & document, copyright. After master degree graduation, I continued working as a research assistant in the project until mid 2013.</p>
<p>In August 2013, I came back to Saigon (a.k.a Ho Chi Minh City) and work as a web developer in Designveloper. I used PHP to develop several websites & an automated messaging web system for CRM</p>
<p>From March 2014, I moved to Danang and work as a Business Analyst at FPT Software. My main responsibility is to get requirements from customer or existing code to write SRS for developer & tester to built or maintain the expected software. These software are in Real Estate industry domain and built upon .NET technology (Windows Form & Asp.NET). I took several onsite trips to US (Texas) for developing system requirements at customer site.</p>
<p>From July 2015, I started working as a web developer in Novahub. My responsibility is to develop and optimize websites using Java Spring, Ruby on Rails, and PHP, mainly in backend. I also coached new joining developer (workflow and process) and student trainee (basic web programming courses).</p>
